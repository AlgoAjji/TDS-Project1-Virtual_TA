# TDS-Project1-Virtual_TA
This is Project-1 of TDS subject, where we are supposed to do a Virtual Assistant for our TAs,
which scrapes the query data, readily available on the IITM BS Degree's discourse forum.

# Important Note: 
This repo does not consist of my private API KEY (.env file) from Open AI API pipeline, which is a vital requirement of this project. I have deployed another similar repo, which works completely fine, but due to privacy concerns of my API key, I haven't included any info about it here. So you are supposed to run it seperately under the environment variable in render!!

# Database push issue in repo
Also, I will be uploading the database in gdrive and will be providing the link in the Database.md file. As I had previously pushed my large db files directly to my repo, 2 of my previous GitHub accounts were flagged. As I don't want to take any further risk, I will just provide the link to my GDrive which has the DataBase.
